<h2> Problem Definition </h2>
<p>
For this project, we need to design and implement algorithms that track multiple objects through a series of frames. We will first test on bats flying across the sky at night and then apply the same codings to a dataset of cells spliting and merging. We will draw different colors of lines to represent the past moving tracks of each object.  </p>
<p>By this project, we will learn about tracking and identifying the same objects from frame to frame, solving more practical issues in a natural environment, and consequently create interesting and interactive graphical applications.
</p>

<h2> Method and Implementation </h2>
<p>1. Initialize the track list</br>
Firstly, we need to initialize a track list that keeps the data for each bat, including velocity vector, the color it represents and a series of its predicted positions. We randomly generate a rgb value to name each bats. And since we do not have velocity for the first frame, we initialize it as [0, 0]. 
</p>
<p>2. Alpha Beta</br>
When we have our list of data set up, we begin the predictions. We use the prediction of k-1 frame, p_k_1, add by v at k-1 to get the rough prediction position of the bat at frame k. Then we find the nearest measurement point to this rough prediction and calculate the residue. Then we apply alpha beta algorithm to adjust the prediction. p' = p + A * r; v' = v + B * r. We test on different combinations of A and B to get the best result. In our case, A = 0.9 and B = 0.003.
</p>

<p>3. Data Association</br>
After we getting the list of predictions at frame k, we associate them with actual measurements at k to assign the predictions to measurements to decide the dead and new bats. We just use greedy algorithm to find the nearest m to the p. If there are two p sharing the same m, we keep the pair with shorter distance and set the other p as a dead bat. We delete the bat of this p from the list. Then we will also have several extra m that are not assigned to any p, and we list them as new bats and add them to the list, with v initialized as [0,0] and previous positions substituted by [-1, -1]. Then we update velocity according to this latest position and last position, and do the rest of the frames.
</p>

<p>4. Graph</br>
We draw the list of prediction positions for each bats with the colors they are assigned. For the newer one with [-1, -1] positions, we hold on those frames until the first non negative one position occurs.
</p>

<p>
Functions:<br>
Predictions -- prediction(k, track) <br>
Alpha Beta -- AlphaBeta(k, p_k_1, v, A, B) <br>
Data Association-- DataAssociation(k, track)<br>
Update track list -- kill(p, a, track) and add(m, a, track)<br>
Update velocity -- updateVelocity(a, m, p, track)<br>
</p>

<h2>Experiments</h2>
<p>Evaluation matrix: accurate tracking of the bats
</p>
1. When the bat is away from other bats and flying alone, the algorithm does a pretty good job. It can track both straight tracks and circular tracks<br>
2. When the bat flies across the other bat, one of the bats will be regarded as missing and assigned a new color. The other one will retain its track.<br>
3. When the bat flies near to a bunch of other bats, the tracks will be disturbed. Since we apply the greedy algorithm that assign the next prediction to the nearest measurement, when they are really near to each other, there will be a chance that the wrong prediction is be assigned
</p>
<p>In general, the algorithms work well when bats fly their own ways. However, due to the choice of our algorithm, when bats are overlapped or simply near to each other, there will be a chance of failure<br>

<h2> Discussion </h2>
<p>
Strengths: In general, we track individual bats quite well, assigning them different colors and draw the lines so that people can see clearlt how the bats flying across the sky in a dark background<br>
Limitations: Our algorithm does not work well when they get close to each other. This mainly due to the choice of our algorithms. For data associationg part, we did not apply multiple hypothesis tracking such that we can know if the bat is actually missing or just incurs an overlap. We just kill a bat and assign it a new color when the overlap finishes. We actually did not even apply bipartite matching, because if we do the greedy the running time would be as large as O(n!), where n is about 60 in our case. So we basically just associate the prediction to the nearest measurement, which will cause the problem that when several bats are near to each other, the track will be really messy. Also, when we kill a bat, we did not clean the old tracks it left behind. So in later frames, it gets messy especially at the bottom right corner. <br>
Potential future works: If we can improve the algorithm, we will firstly definitely use Kalman Filter to replace the Alpha Beta. Kalman contains Gaussion blobs which make the prediction more accurate. Also, we should use Multiple Hypothesis Tracking to do the data association. We should also delete the dead bat tracks from the frames.

<h2> Conclusions </h2>

<p>
In conclusion, our algorithms work well in tracking individual object. When there are too many objects come together, the tracks might get a little bit messy. But in general, we can see clearly the past moving tracks of most objects from frame to frame.</p>
